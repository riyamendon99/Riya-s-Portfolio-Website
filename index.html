                    <p>What is a paragraph? Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
                        paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is
                        half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is
                        what constitutes a paragraph. The oldest classical British and Latin writing had little or no
                        space between words and could be written in boustrophedon (alternating directions). Over time,
                        text direction (left to right) became standardized. Word dividers and terminal punctuation
                        became common. The first way to divide sentences into groups was the original paragraphos,
                        similar to an underscore at the beginning of the new group.[1] The Greek parágraphos evolved
                        into the pilcrow (¶), which in English manuscripts in the Middle Ages can be seen inserted
                        inline between sentences.
                        Ancient manuscripts also divided sentences into paragraphs with line breaks (newline) followed
                        by an initial at the beginning of the next paragraph. An initial is an oversized capital letter,
                        sometimes outdented beyond the margin of the text. This style can be seen, for example, in the
                        original Old English manuscript of Beowulf. Outdenting is still used in English typography,
                        though not commonly.[2] Modern English typography usually indicates a new paragraph by indenting
                        the first line. This style can be seen in the (handwritten) United States Constitution from
                        1787. For additional ornamentation, a hedera leaf or other symbol can be added to the
                        inter-paragraph white space, or put in the indentation space.</p>

                    big challenge. The current systems deployed in organizations are not efficient, not accurate and are
                    difficult to use. Many times, organizations handle the IoT devices, their data, and their
                    connectivity manually, without any automation. The main idea of our project is to develop a web
                    application that helps to control, monitor and record sensor data in real-time. This system must be
                    easy enough to be utilized by non-technical users as well as administrators. It aims at providing a
                    real-time visual representation of the location of devices, predicts their expiry dates, generates
                    reports of the performance of the individual devices on a periodic time basis. The users will have
                    full access to the devices and the ability to manage the devices remotely. This project is not
                    organization-specific, and it aims to serve any or every department which utilizes IoT devices for
                    their functioning. Our primary stakeholders would be the Administrator of the organization. Our
                    secondary stakeholder includes the users
                    that work with the data generated by the devices and utilize them in the organization.</p>
